# basic-naive-multicycle-cpu
This was the first "big" project I have done with Verilog; this project was the last assignment in one of my university courses. The course is named “Interfacing analog and digital worlds”.

In the assignment we were given a basic and very (very) naïve design for an 9-bit multi cycle CPU, and needed to implement it accordingly. In that project we were also given a basic structure for the registers and a skeleton for the top file.

Eventually the code was burnt on and FPGA and tested.

I believe that if I had to do this project again, I would have written the code differently, and also use System Verilog instead. 
I guess that in the near future I will go over it again, rewrite it and test it with a proper testbench.
